# Projects

> If there's one thing I love - it's a QUALITY weekend project.   Electronics, software, computers, science, radio and lots goofing around.  Mostly I break stuff -- but every so often I finish a project so cool it must be shared!  If you like my projects (Thank you!) consider joining my quest to [HOST THE WORLD](https://josephsamela.github.io/show/).

## [wget-mirror](https://josephsamela.github.io/wget-mirror/)
Here's the situation - I need to mirror a remote webpage locally. Problem is - the webpage can be updated at any time, and the mirror needs to stay current. Here’s my solution! Python script uses a tailored wget command to download mirrorized site, updating on 1hr intervals. I tried many flag combinations and this is what works best for a single page local mirror, see flag explainations below. In my environment . is pointed to the htdocs folder of my Apache webserver. Edit mirror.py with your domain and webserver directory of choice, then run!

## [Dice Calculator](https://josephsamela.github.io/dice-calculator/)
When you’re DM for a party of 10 in combat with 25 NPCs each moving and attacking on tricky terrain with buffs, status, environmental effects – you’re rolling a lot of dice.

Don’t get me wrong I love the analog experience of good old-fashion dice rolls and tracking stats with paper and clipboard. But sometimes this slows us down – the 3 hour campaign reaches hour 6. It’s 1am. Todd can’t roll dice without dropping them on the floor. Speed up the game. More adventure. More exploration. Better stories.
