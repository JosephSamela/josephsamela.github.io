# Projects

> ## If there's one thing I love - it's a QUALITY weekend project.   Electronics, software, computers, science, radio and lots goofing around.  Mostly I break stuff -- but every so often I finish a project so cool it must be shared!  If you like my projects (thank you!) consider joining my quest to [HOST THE WORLD](https://josephsamela.github.io/show/).

## [Find-the-red-car](https://github.com/JosephSamela/computer-vision-color-based-search)

Special forces mobilize! Computer vision activate! Enhance! 

In this exercise I use the python imaging library to locate red cars from aerial images of parking lots. To understand the surveillance state...you must become the surveillance state! Wait, that can't be right...

## [weather-util-flask-api](https://josephsamela.github.io/weather-util-flask-api/)
Flask wrapper around [weather-util](http://fungi.yuggoth.org/weather/) that provides simple, light, human-readable, weather reports.

* **simple** - No ads, no banners, no fancy interactive trackers. Visit `/your-zip-code` and get the weather report.

* **light** - no javascript, no css, no images, no icons, not even a favicon. These pages use little data and load fast.

* **human-readable** - No mind-numbing XML from this API. Simple easy to read plaintext reports for humans.

## [IFTTT Webhook Notifications](https://josephsamela.github.io/ifttt-webhook-notifications/)
IFTTT offers free-no-strings-attached webhooks for use in personal projects. I've been experimenting with these on my latest Raspberry Pi project to send notifications to my phone. The project is an always-active webcam pointed at a scenic vista that posts to Instagram and streams to Youtube. When a job finishes, or error occurs I get immediately notified - pretty cool! Here are some examples to help get *you* get started!

## [Lakecam](https://josephsamela.github.io/lakecam/)
Social media is hard. The algorithem expects consistant uploads with unique content, and I just don't have the time. So I built `Lakecam` a Raspberry Pi controlled webcam that posts to Instagram and streams to YouTube. It was developed for Quaboag Lakecam Project but could be useful for other applications too!

## [OBS Macro Scene Switcher](https://josephsamela.github.io/obs-macro-scene-switcher/)

## [docker-flask-hello-world](https://josephsamela.github.io/docker-flask-hello-world/)
Docker is powerful. Docker has a learning curve. Docker is a giant whale with a shipping container backpack. Start off small and build up with the simplest flask app you can make with docker! This example walks through setting up a dockerfile, organizing your container and packaing your app. Good luck!

## [canvas-random-circles-artwork](https://josephsamela.github.io/canvas-random-circles-artwork/)
Every artist has their medium. From the ancient to the modern - each medium guides the artist with a framework of expression. My medium? The html5 canvas. Inspired by Jackson Pollock and the Mozilla Internet Health Report I present *canvas-random-circles-artwork* a randomly-generated work of digital art!

## [Elasticsearch-jquery-example](https://josephsamela.github.io/elasticsearch-jquery-example/)
The web is a wild place with no instruction manual. Some say querying a database is the job of servers. I say it's every-man-for-himself. There ain't no model-view-controller gonna hold me down. Here's a dead simple example to POST and GET data from Elasticsearch using jquery - directly from the browser. Live dangerously.🌵☠️⚡

## [wget-mirror](https://josephsamela.github.io/wget-mirror/)
Here's the situation - I need to mirror a remote webpage locally. Problem is - the webpage can be updated at any time, and the mirror needs to stay current. Here’s my solution! Python script uses a tailored wget command to download mirrorized site, updating on 1hr intervals. I tried many flag combinations and this is what works best for a single page local mirror, see flag explainations below. In my environment . is pointed to the htdocs folder of my Apache webserver. Edit mirror.py with your domain and webserver directory of choice, then run!

## [colorize-tabs](https://josephsamela.github.io/colorize-tabs/)
Since Chrome 39 shipped with Android Lollipop in 2014 websites can use theme-color to customize the browser toolbar. Unfortunately theme-color still remains unsupported on the desktop - just light gray with favicons. This makes me sad - so I decided to take action. Introducing "Colorize Tabs" the browser extension that colors tabs to match a website's theme-color.

Seriously, this is *real*! If you use Firefox and wish the web was a more beautiful place - consider trying my first browser extension.

## [hyperv-quick-create-gallery-generator](https://josephsamela.github.io/hyperv-quick-create-gallery-generator/)
Hyper-V Quick Create is great - but making that `.json` gallery is a massive pain! Here's a python script to generate that file for you! Included in this repo is an example to show how to build you gallery. Remember you need to add the path to `gallery.json` to registry `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Virtualization`.

## [Note](https://josephsamela.github.io/note/)
I'm a simple man. When I get thoughts, I write them down. I don't open another tab, enter incognito mode, log into my personal account then create a new note that get's synced throughout all time and space. Hell, I don't even leave the terminal. I just type `note` and start writing. `note` is a Simple & Fast note taking utility for the command line. Use the lightning-quick cli text editor you love and let `note` organize all your notes in the background. .

## [Dice Calculator](https://josephsamela.github.io/dice-calculator/)
When you’re DM for a party of 10 in combat with 25 NPCs each moving and attacking on tricky terrain with buffs, status, environmental effects – you’re rolling a lot of dice.

Don’t get me wrong I love the analog experience of good old-fashion dice rolls and tracking stats with paper and clipboard. But sometimes this slows us down – the 3 hour campaign reaches hour 6. It’s 1am. Todd can’t roll dice without dropping them on the floor. Speed up the game. More adventure. More exploration. Better stories.

## [Mosaic for Lego Digital Designer](https://josephsamela.github.io/Mosaic-for-Lego-Digital-Designer/)
At a LEGO convention I saw a velocoraptor statue made from legos and was instatly intruged. LEGO has artists built a metal skeleton for the piece, then laborously contructed a shell from LEGO bricks. I thought this was fastenating and immediately started to hypothesize a machine for "printing" these sculptures. I drew up schematics for a gigantic 3D printer contraption with a carrosel of 6ft-long magazines containing LEGO bricks of every color. Then I saw how much LEGO *cost*. I will stick with 2D for now...

This application turns any image into a beautiful LEGO mosaic compatible with Lego Digital Designer!

## [Flask socketio chartist](https://josephsamela.github.io/flask-socketio-chartist.js/)
When you to *real-time* signal data in a webpage. Flask + socketio + chartist.js is a killer combo. Here'a bare-bones flask app using socket.io to stream data to client drawing charts with Chartist.js! This example is ready to rock and roll! Install required python packages and run `main.py`. From there start hacking and make something amazing!

## [LED Weather Station](https://josephsamela.github.io/led-matrix-weatherstation/)
Beautiful LED Matrix to display the weather! Powered by the Raspberry Pi and Adafruit RGB Matrix Hat. This project will brighten your living room (literally) with the weather displayed on georgous LED matrix. If I did this over, I would select a different weather API but the project is finished and the lesson learned. Fantastic conversation piece 10/10 💯.
